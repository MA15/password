# Password Generator Starter Code
This is my Password Generator. Once clicked the generator asks how many characters you would like within a range of 8-128 characters. It then proceeds to ask whether you would like to use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, or special characters.

Once all aspects are checked the generator will give you a random password.
